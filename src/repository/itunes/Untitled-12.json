When the pair link Harriet’s disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from almost forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vanger’s are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves."

But after only five weeks of dating, the love-struck Dustin is coming on so strong that Alexis is forced to slow things down – permanently. Devastated and desperate to get her back, Dustin turns to his best friend, Tank, the rebound specialist. A master at seducing – and offending – women, Tank gets hired by freshly dumped guys to take their ex-girlfriends out on the worst date of their lives – an experience so horrible it sends them running gratefully back to their beaus. But when Tank works his magic on Alexis, he ends up meeting the challenge of a lifetime. Alexis is the first girl who knows how to call his bluff, and Tank soon finds himself torn between his loyalty to Dustin and a strange new attraction to his best friend's girl."

She's thrilled to be studying ballet at a prestigious performing arts school, but her classmates are so talented—and she can't help feeling that she's always in the shadow of her \"perfect\" older sister, Jade. So when her idol, a famous ballerina, encourages her to audition for a professional ballet, Isabelle isn't sure she can land the role. And when a competitive classmate starts pointing out Isabelle's every mistake, her confidence sinks even further. Can she find the courage to step into the spotlight and discover her own way to shine?"

In this second installment of Stieg Larsson’s phenomenal “Millennium” trilogy, Lisbeth Salander is a wanted woman. A researcher and a Millennium journalist about to expose the truth about the sex trade in Sweden are brutally murdered and Salander’s prints are on the weapon. Her history of unpredictable and violent behavior makes her an official danger to society. Mikael Blomkvist, Salander’s friend and Millennium’s publisher, is alone in his belief of Salander’s innocence. Digging deeper, Blomkvist unearths evidence implicating highly placed members of Swedish society – as well as shocking details about Salander’s past. He is desperate to get to her before she is cornered – but no one can find her anywhere."

They don't have a feud, most of them really like each other so that is another thing they don't have in common with the Jets and the Sharks. What they do have in common with The Jets and The Sharks is they love to dance. And when I say dance, I mean SKATE. And when I say SKATE, I mean really good. From the directors that brought you Mouse, Yeah Right and Fully Flared, another chapter in this tale with no plot, no ending but beautiful inner battles acted out on a little board with wheels."

But after only five weeks of dating, the love-struck Dustin is coming on so strong that Alexis is forced to slow things down - permanently. Devastated and desperate to get her back, Dustin turns to his best friend, Tank, the rebound specialist. A master at seducing - and offending - women, Tank gets hired by freshly dumped guys to take their ex-girlfriends out on the worst date of their lives - an experience so horrible it sends them running gratefully back to their beaus. But when Tank works his magic on Alexis, he ends up meeting the challenge of a lifetime. Alexis is the first girl who knows how to call his bluff, and Tank soon finds himself torn between his loyalty to Dustin and a strange new attraction to his best friend's girl.",

Aspiring reporter Kit Kittredge can't resist bringing home strays, whether it's Grace, an abandoned basset hound, or Will (Max Thieriot) and Countee (Willow Smith), a pair of young hobos willing to trade work for meals. Bright, inquisitive and generous, Kit is a natural born leader. But her happy childhood is abruptly interrupted when her father (Chris O'Donnell) loses his car dealership and must leave Cincinnati to look for work. Kit and her mother Margaret (Julia Ormond) are left to manage on their own, growing vegetables, selling eggs and even taking in an assortment of boarders including an itinerant magician (Stanley Tucci), a vivacious dance instructor on the prowl for a husband (Jane Krakowski) and a zany mobile librarian (Joan Cusack)."

Academy® Award nominated director Amy Berg strips away Janis’ rock ‘n roll persona to reveal the gentle, trusting, sensitive, but powerful woman behind the legend, in the quintessential story of the short, turbulent, and epic existence that changed music forever.\r\nInterviews paint a new, intimate portrait of Janis the woman.  Through turbulent and tormented love affairs, and stretches of drugs and sobriety, one constant remained: Janis was committed to her music above all until her heartbreaking demise and death at the age of 27."

Amanda Bynes (\"What I Like About You\") stars as Daphne Reynolds, a spirited 17-year-old New Yorker who travels to London to find her long-lost father. In contrast to her bohemian mother, Daphne discovers her father, Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth--Bridget Jones' Diary), to be a very proper politician and English gentleman. Undaunted, Daphne dives into a schedule of stuffy social events, determined to prove that love--and proper etiquette--can conquer all. But as hard as she tries to reunite her parents and make a bid for \"Debutante of the Year,\" Daphne cannot conceal her irrepressible personality or hide What a Girl Wants."

On assignment for her high-school yearbook, social-misfit Anne (Dylan Gelula) charmingly hits it off with the beautiful star of the softball team, Sasha (Brianna Hildebrand). But when Anne tells her best friend Clifton (Mateo Arias) about her new crush, he reveals a hidden jealousy that threatens more than just the girls’ budding romance. Writer/director Kerem Sanga tells this remarkably touching story with a multifaceted style that is as fresh as it is daring. Brimming with authenticity and humor, First Girl I Loved offers a delightful, contemporary perspective on the jitters of new romance and the age-old heartbreak of love."

The Iranian ghost town, home to prostitutes, junkies, pimps, and other sordid souls, is a place that reeks of death and hopelessness, where a lonely vampire is stalking the towns' most unsavory inhabitants. But when boy meets girl, an unusual love story begins to blossom...blood red.The first Iranian Vampire Western, Ana Lily Amirpour's debut feature basks in the sheer pleasure of pulp. A joyful mash-up of genre, archetype and iconography, its prolific influences span spaghetti westerns, graphic novels, horror films, and the Iranian New Wave. Amped by a mix of Iranian rock, techno and Morricone-inspired riffs, its airy, anamorphic, black-and-white aesthetic and artfully drawn out scenes combined with simmering tension to make the first Iranian Vampire Western.",

With her mother busy helping the war effort at home by working for the Red Cross, Molly finds herself having to handle life's problems and changes on her own - including her family taking in a 10 year-old refugee from London. But through all the adjustments, Molly keeps a positive attitude and a determined spirit which was the backbone of America's home front during a critical time. Third in a series of TV movies based on the \"American Girl\" book and product line, this story will allow girls to imagine how different life was for girls growing up in the 1940s, and to discover that their feelings, ideas and dreams were surprisingly similar to those of Molly and her friends."

Opportunity comes knocking when she flukes a winter-long catering job in one of the plushest ski chalets in the Alps.

Then Kim discovers snowboarding, and her natural talent soon sees her training for the end-of-season competition, with a chance to win major prize money. But before she can become a champion again, Kim needs to overcome her deepest fears – and figure out what’s going on with Jonny (Ed Westwick), her boss’ handsome but apparently unavailable son."

Desperate for cash, Ashley attempts to smuggle a Mexican family across the border. But when the crossing ends in tragedy, Ashley is stranded with a young girl desperate to find her family.
